As a styling library, I wrote various SASS functions with the company's brand's manual to be used in the Blade templates. <br><br> As a second version, for security and speed, we migrated all backend CMS to a Vue + Node service and served all data to the Laravel Front End via APIs. I upgraded all our Blade templates into Blade Components for reusability and maintainability. For new Components, I had to design them and get them approved, which I did with Adobe XD. <br><br> We then migrated our Blade Components to Vue components for optimization. This meant I had to teach our team Vue. <br><br> As the last version we migrated our complete Laravel Front End to Nuxt and switched our SASS library for TailwindCSS.",
